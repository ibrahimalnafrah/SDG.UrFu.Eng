- **Support decision-making** for sustainable development initiatives
- **Facilitate targeted analysis** of organizational activities and reports

## 🚀 Features

- **Multi-label Classification**: Provides probability scores for all 17 SDGs
- **Flexible Input Options**: Accept both direct text input and file uploads
- **Interactive Visualizations**: Dynamic charts showing classification results
- **User-Friendly Interface**: No technical expertise required
- **Detailed Results**: Probability percentages for informed decision-making
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile devices

## 📊 Supported SDGs

16. **Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions** - Promote peaceful and inclusive societies
17. **Partnerships for the Goals** - Strengthen the means of implementation

## 💻 How It Works

The SDG Text Classifier uses advanced machine learning algorithms to analyze text and determine its alignment with the UN's Sustainable Development Goals. Simply input your text or upload a document, and the system will provide probability scores indicating how strongly your content relates to each of the 17 SDGs.

## 📝 How to Use

### Step 1: Input Your Text
- **Direct Input**: Type or paste your text in the text area
- **File Upload**: Upload a `.txt` file containing your document

### Step 2: Classify
- Click the "Classify" button to analyze your text
- Wait a few seconds for processing

### Step 3: Interpret Results
- **Bar Chart**: Visual representation of SDG alignment probabilities
- **Results Table**: Detailed probability scores sorted by relevance
- **Hover Information**: Additional details when hovering over chart elements

### Example Use Cases
- **Corporate Reports**: Classify sustainability reports to identify SDG alignment
- **Research Papers**: Analyze academic papers for SDG relevance
- **Project Proposals**: Evaluate project descriptions for SDG targeting
- **Policy Documents**: Assess policy texts for sustainable development focus
- **Grant Applications**: Identify which SDGs your project addresses

## 🎯 Understanding Results

### Probability Scores
- **High Scores (>50%)**: Strong alignment with the SDG
- **Medium Scores (20-50%)**: Moderate relevance to the SDG
- **Low Scores (<20%)**: Limited or no alignment with the SDG

### Multiple Classifications
Documents often align with multiple SDGs. The classifier provides scores for all 17 goals, allowing you to:
- Identify primary SDG focus areas
- Recognize secondary alignments
- Understand the document's comprehensive SDG profile

## ❓ Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: What types of documents work best with this classifier?**
A: The classifier works optimally with policy documents, research papers, project descriptions, corporate reports, and other text-based content related to sustainability and development topics.

**Q: What file formats are supported?**
A: The application accepts plain text input directly or through .txt file uploads. Please copy and paste the text content.

**Q: Is there a text length limit?**
A: The classifier works best with documents of at least 100 words. Very short texts may produce less reliable results.

**Q: How should I interpret the probability scores?**
A: Scores above 50% indicate strong alignment, 20-50% suggest moderate relevance, and below 20% show limited alignment with specific SDGs.

**Q: Can the tool classify documents in languages other than English?**
A: Currently, the classifier is optimized for English text. Non-English content may produce less accurate results.
